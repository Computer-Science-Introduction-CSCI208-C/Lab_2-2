# Introduction to Programming II (C++) 
# Lab  2-2
**Part 2-Classes**

This project consists of creating a program that represents a small car dealership's inventory using `classes`. 

## Minimum Viable Product

- [ ] Create a file with the information for each car in the dealership's inventory. (i.e: `Jeep Wrangler 2018 50000`) 
- [ ]  Create a struct that contains the following information: 
- make (string) 
- model (string) 
- year (int) 
- price (int)


- [ ] The information for each car should then be read as input from the file to create each struct. 
- [ ] After all five structs are created, two output files (economy and luxury) should be created. 
- [ ] For each car, if the price is above $40,000, then the car's information should be written into the `luxury file`. If the price is less than or equal to $40,000, then the car's information should be written into the `economy file`. 

## Note
Consider doing some validation by changing the price of the cars to ensure the code remains accurate.
